				Welcome to the Friend Unifying Platform!

			<h2>
				Version 1.0 beta2 Open Source edition - 07.03.2016
			</h2>
			
			<p>Welcome to our second public beta. We have worked hard behind the scenes and tried to increase the usefulness of FriendUP with this release. We will start with the most improved and nice new added apps:</p>
			
			<h3>App updates (click app name or icon to start the app)</h3>

			<p><a href="javascript:ExecuteApplication('Author')"><img src="apps/Author/icon.png" style="float:left; margin-right:12px; width:32px; height:32px; display:inline-block; padding:6px; border-radius:8px; background:#FFF; box-shadow:0px 0px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);" /> <strong style="font-weight:700;"> Author</strong></a> has received a lot of new features. Our goal is to have a fully fledged writing tool by version 1.0. For now we have a better GUI, centered, page-like canvas for writing, as well as more editing options.</p>
			<p style="overflow:hidden; height:16px; clear:both; flaot:none;"><em></em></p>

			<p><a href="javascript:ExecuteApplication('Wallpaper')"><img src="apps/Wallpaper/icon.png" style="float:left; margin-right:12px; width:32px; height:32px; display:inline-block; padding:6px; border-radius:8px; background:#FFF; box-shadow:0px 0px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);" /> <strong style="font-weight:700;">Wallpaper</strong></a> - Fallback on background color, better control over wallpaper and icon window background.</p>
			<p style="overflow:hidden; height:16px; clear:both; flaot:none;"><em></em></p>
			
			<p><a href="javascript:ExecuteApplication('Dingo')"><img src="apps/Dingo/icon.png" style="float:left; margin-right:12px; width:32px; height:32px; display:inline-block; padding:6px; border-radius:8px; background:#FFF; box-shadow:0px 0px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);" /> <strong style="font-weight:700;">Shell</strong></a> - our Dingo shell gets its focus back after operations.</p>
			<p style="overflow:hidden; height:16px; clear:both; flaot:none;"><em></em></p>

			<p><a href="javascript:ExecuteApplication('Calculator')"><img src="apps/Calculator/icon.png" style="float:left; margin-right:12px; width:32px; height:32px; display:inline-block; padding:6px; border-radius:8px; background:#FFF; box-shadow:0px 0px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);" /> <strong style="font-weight:700;">Calculator</strong></a> - a very simple calculator ported to FriendUP :)</p>

			<h2>
				Version 0.1
			</h2>
			<p>
				You are watching history in the making. We are bringing you a new web based platform where you can work, learn and play.
				As this is our first beta version of the Friend Unifying Platform, you might expect a few bugs. Some things might not
				work as you expect it. Some things might fail. This is why you are here - to help us find the quirks so that we can
				make this a great experience for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				FriendUP has a very simple and easy to use interface. Take some time and review the information below before you
				get started. FriendUP is themable - but these instructions rely on the default theme.
			</p>
			<hr class="Space"/>
			<h2>
				Window bar
			</h2>
			<p>
				Our window bar has 3 buttons on the top.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="/webclient/gfx/update_info.jpg" alt="Info" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #c0c0c0"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Close button on the top left.<br/>
				The maximize/un-maximize and the send to foreground/background buttons on the right.<br/>
				Double clicking the window header will set the window to the foreground. You can also use the header to drag windows across the screen.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Title bar
			</h2>
			<p>
				On top of the screen you can find our "title bar". It will display menus depending on the application that is in focus. It can also be dragged down to reveal an overview over running processes. 					You can easily terminate a process just by clicking on it. The menus will display when using the right mouse button. On Mac, you wil have to hold down CTRL + the left mouse button (if you have a one-button mouse).
			</p>
			<h2>
				Clicks
			</h2>
			<p>
				We use simple clicks, double clicks and righthand clicks - just like most other user interfaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our dock works with single clicks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our touch interface uses simple clicks. We must admit that there a a lot of features that are not quite there yet in this initial beta.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we code on desktops this is where we had our focus. We are gonna change that!
			</p>
			<p>
				We admit it right here: our interface on a tablet lacks as a lot of the mobile optimisations are not implemented yet.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Enjoy!</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				As this is a very early beta we hope you enjoy it and give us constructive feedback at <a href="mailto:titlestad@friendos.com">titlestad@friendos.com</a>.
				And remember, you can find this window in the Doors menu.
