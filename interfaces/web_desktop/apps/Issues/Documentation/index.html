				Introduction

			<p>
				Welcome to the issue tracker in FriendUP. Please refer to this
				document if you are stuck or need information on how to make 
				the best of Issues.

				What is an issue tracker?
			</h2>
			<p>
				An issue tracker is where you add bug reports and feature requests
				in a software project. You add an issue and a moderator or 
				administrator upgrades the status on the issue until the issue
				is "fixed" and "closed".
			</p>
			<h2>

				How to use Issues
			</h2>
			<p>
				When you start <strong>Issues</strong>, you have the top toolbar,
				where you can search and filter the issues list. Then below, you
				have the scroll pane, where you can see all the existing issues
				sorted or filtered by status. On the bottom you see the bottom
				toolbar, where you can report an issue.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you have an issue to report, click on the "Report issue" 
				button on the bottom toolbar. This will bring up a new view
				where you can describe your issue. Once you have filled in all
				the form fields there, you can click on "Save issue". This will
				submit your issue to the administrators for review.
