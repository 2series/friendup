				Introduction
			</h2>
			<p>
				FriendUP's graphical user interface is called <strong>Friend Workspace</strong>.
				This software allows you to use FriendUP across all your PCs and
				other devices in an uniform way, save for interface adaptions that make
				sense on each device.
			</p>
			<p>
				Workspace is divided into four sections. The bottom part is where you can
				manage your views (or windows). When opening views, you can minimize them
				to the task manager. Here, you can click on a button for each task to bring
				them back again. On mobile, it looks a little bit different from the 
				desktop version. On mobile, the dock icons for launching apps is located 
				on the bottom right. The volume icons for opening your mounted devices
				are located on the bottom left.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the desktop version, your volumes are located on the left side of the
				screen. These are your mounted devices. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the desktop version, the application dock is located on the left side
				of the screen. You can drag and drop icons from file directories to dock
				them there. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The top part of the screen is for screen management. On the desktop version,
				you will see a white "title bar" that initially says Workspace. This bar will
				tell you if you are running a fullscreen application or the main Workspace
				screen.
			</p>
			<h2>

				File management
			</h2>
			<p>
				Friend Workspace has a spacial file manager built into the 
				desktop environment. The file manager divides files into
				volumes (disk drives) and directories (or folders). Each 
				volume and directory can store its window dimension and size.
			</p>
			<p>
				The file manager allows you to select multiple files with the 
				shift or control keys held down. You can also select by holding
				down the mouse key and using a rectangular selection.
			</p>
			<p>
				Single files, or selections, can be dragged to other volumes
				or directories. When dragging from one volume to another,
				the files are copied. When dragging from a directory to another
				on the same volume, the files are moved. To enforce copying,
				you can hold down the shift key.
			</p>
			<p>
				The file manager allows you to delete files by selecting them
				and using the delete option in the Icons menu at the top of
				the screen.
