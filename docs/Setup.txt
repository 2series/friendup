Setting up the Friend Unifying Platform
---------------------------------------

After you have compiled and installed FriendUP, you need to setup
the configuration file. This is easy, and an example of a valid file
is available in this directory.

The configuration file must be placed like this:

	build/cfg/cfg.ini

If you are enabling HTTPS, you need to add your certificate in the
folder:

	build/cfg/crt/

At the time of writing, take your PEM file, which is setup with
certificate first, then public key, in the files:

	build/cfg/crt/certificate.pem
	build/cfg/crt/request.pem
	build/cfg/crt/key.pem
