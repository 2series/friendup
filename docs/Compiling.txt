How to compile Friend Unifying Platform
---------------------------------------

When developing FriendUP, we tried to keep the list of dependencies
as low as possible while keeping dependencies where was required
and logical. The current list of dependencies for Debian or Ubuntu
based Linux distributions:

	libssh2-1-dev
	libssh-dev
	libssl-dev
	libaio-dev
	php5-cli
	php5-curl
	php5-mysql
	php5-gd
	php5-imap
	mysql-server
	libmysqlclient-dev
	build-essential
	libmatheval-dev
	libmagic-dev
	libgd-dev
	libwebsockets-dev

To install these, copy and paste the following in a terminal:

	sudo apt-get install libssh2-1-dev libssh-dev libssl-dev libaio-dev \
	php5-cli php5-curl php5-mysql php5-gd php5-imap mysql-server \
	libmysqlclient-dev build-essential libmatheval-dev libmagic-dev \
	libgd-dev libwebsockets-dev rsync

Once you have installed the dependencies, the way to compile and install
FriendUP is as follows:

	make clean && make setup && make compile
	make install

This will install FriendUP in the subdirectory "build/". Here you will
find the executable "FriendCore", that runs the Friend Server.

Please read more about how to set up FriendUP in the document, "Setup.txt".
