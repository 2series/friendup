	The SQLWorkgroupDrive DOS driver allows you to abstract an SQL 
	database as a filesystem with disk based binary storage. The SQL drive
	gives you the ability to program the behaviour of your file 
	system to fit your needs, and is therefore a great template
	for intelligent, dynamic file systems. This DOS driver is adapted to
	support workgroups.
