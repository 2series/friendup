Introduction
------------

FriendUP is a new meta operating system and web OS for posix
hosts. It allows a user to have an operating system experience
on any device that has a HTML5 web browser available. For 
developers and administrators, it allows for a uniform way of
working with low level components as well as servers.

At the moment, FriendUP is in beta. For this reason, there will
be lacks and bugs. Please visit our website to report such bugs.
In the near future, we will make available an issue tracker in
every release of FriendUP.
