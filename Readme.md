Friend Unifying Platform version 1.0.0
==================================

We are happy to announce the release of FriendUP version 1.0.0.

FriendUP version 1.0.0 is the first complete open source release of the platform. It introduces a complete vision for the next paradigm in computing. FriendUP comes complete with a powerful kernel-like web server that supports multiple protocols and data sources, next to resource- and user session management. This offers javascript developers a fresh backendless environment in which to accelerate their development of exciting new applications and games. 

Across devices
--------------

With its responsive desktop environment and client-side, javascript based technologies, FriendUP offers a new reality where you work and play online, independently from your local web enabled hardware. By supporting all screen formats, from mobile phones to laptops and VR, FriendUP is a single target through which you can reach the entire user market.
We have used considerable amount of time on making the FriendUP APIs simple and easy to understand. That is also why we are packaging the FriendUP Developers Manual with this release. In its third draft, it will soon cover the entire 1.0.x platform.

Distributed and powerful
------------------------

FriendUP aims to make the powerful emerging web technologies easy to work with. This is why we reach out to you, to help us enrich this platform with DOS drivers, modules, libraries and apps so that we can cover all of the interesting technologies out there that people use and love.
In the Future, FriendUP will be to the cloud users what Linux is for machines.
